Lagos Airport Continue Activities Despite NLCâ€™s Declaration Of Warning Strike

Airlines operating from the General Aviation Terminal (GAT) of the Lagos Airport have gone ahead to board passengers who earlier checked in defying officials of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) who tried to stop them.

While Government offices were shut down in Ekiti State in cooperation with the strike, courts in Lagos were also locked, stopping lawyers and litigants who resumed for work, from accessing their offices, Naija News reports.

NLC officials stormed the departures hall this morning and physically stopped officials of Arik Air and Air Peace from checking in passengers or selling tickets.

In defiance of the NLC officials, the airlines announced boarding for Abuja and Jos, their first flights.

Before this NLC officials took over the counters of the airlines chanting solidarity songs. Following the commotion, the airlines suspended check in process but continued with boarding passengers who had earlier checked in.
