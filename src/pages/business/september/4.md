Reports reaching NIGERIA NEWS reveal that President Muhammadu Buhari in a few days from now will be signing about 25 deals with China.

Recall that NIGERIA NEWS in recent reports brought to you that Buhari is currently in China for the 7th Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).

The Presidency made this known via Garba Shehu who is the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity.

According to him, “Agreements are already being signed. As of today, eight agreements have been signed and we expect that about 25 of such agreements will be signed before the delegation returns to Nigeria.”
In his words, “the government hopes to draw more financial support from China, to drive key infrastructural projects in the country.”


“Following the last summit in South Africa, the investment by China in Nigeria in -particular has more than doubled, with the increasing financing of infrastructure, railway, roads, bridges and power. So, on a government to government level, we expect that we will be drawing a lot more financing from China for key infrastructural projects.”
