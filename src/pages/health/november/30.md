The Ondo State government has warned residents against yellow fever outbreak in several parts of the country, Naija News understands.

The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro, in a statement said the residents should be proactive as the outbreak had spread to neighbouring states; a situation he says calls for serious concern.

Adegbenro described yellow fever as a serious viral infection that can affect all ages, and usually transmitted by mosquitoes.
