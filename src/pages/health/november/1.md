Five people have been confirmed dead, while 16 others are hospitalized at the Primary Health Centre, Kembu in Balanga Local Government Area of  Gombe state, following Cholera outbreak in the state.

The state Acting Epidemiologist, Dr Nuhu Bile, who disclosed this today said that the cholera outbreak occurred in October.

According to him, 70 patients were treated and discharged, while the five people died before medical help could reach them.
