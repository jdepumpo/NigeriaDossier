Agbaje said, “At Iwo, we got a report that security agencies arrested someone with about N600,000 cash near their polling unit. It was earlier this morning. The person was arrested and he is already with the police.

“I would not know the party he belongs. We are not interested in any party, we are interested that somebody came there, that is why the police are investigating. The person is already with the police.

“We said it that people should not bring money near a polling station. Anybody that does that, would be arrested.”
