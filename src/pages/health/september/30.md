Highlights

    The 2019-2021 Humanitarian Program Cycle (HPC) workshop was intended to discuss the key results of the state-level Humanitarian Needs Overview workshops carried out in August/September 2018, and on this basis agree on the most critical needs to be highlighted in the 2019 HNO as well as how these will inform the response priorities of the 2019-2021 HRP. Participants included Government of Nigeria representatives at federal and state levels, in addition to the Humanitarian Coordinator, the Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator, the Humanitarian Country Team, the Inter-Sector Working Group and other key representatives.


    The key objectives of the HRP workshop were to present inter-sectoral and sectoral analysis resulting from the assessments conducted and agree on a tentative set of ‘planning figures’ emerging from available data. The workshop agreed on proposed 2019 HRP strategic objectives and review expected outcomes as well as key changes/adjustments to be reflected compared to last year’s HRP and key inter-sectoral response priorities on the basis of which sectors can develop sector strategies and projects.'
